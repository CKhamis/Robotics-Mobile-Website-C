# Robotics Mobile Website C
This was the third iteration of my mobile robotics websites after the previous two halted development for design differences. This new version featured a radical new design inspired by Windows phone OS.

Unfortunately, the latest build of this project could not be recovered. This featured small Javascript improvements and an Easter egg.

This project was discontinued during development because my mentor again changed their ideas on what the design should be. After this, I was transferred onto re-making the desktop website.

## Categories
This featured a greater emphasis on categories, as they were all displayed on the home page with a brief description for each one. 

## Design
As mentioned earlier, this design was partially inspired by Windows Phone OS. Information was split into different tiles that were transparent enough to see the background. Each category was assigned to a specific color that remained consistent in their own pages. Buttons across the website also featured colorful outlines to make the design more cohesive.

# Why Mobile?
At the time, I hadn't learned about responsive web design, and I was specifically assigned to make a mobile version of the website to go along with the older desktop version.
